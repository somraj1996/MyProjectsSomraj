# Soil-moisture-Monitoring-using-arduino-sensors-with-machine-learning
(Team member : Somraj Paul, Soham Roy, Biswajit Nayak)
Arduino based soil moisture sensor, Arduino UNO and DST22 sensor are used in this project. At first the model was build to collect relevant data of the project ,
After that Machine learning algorithm is used to predict the moisture of the field without using soil moisture sensors.
